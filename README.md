# Spam Detection Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning application focused on spam detection using a unigram approach. It evaluates whether a message is spam by calculating probabilities based on each word's frequency. The program processes testing and training data files, trains the model, tests it, and returns a JSON file with the spam probability of each message. Additionally, it provides the accuracy and precision of the model.

### Features

- **Unigram Approach**: Utilizes a unigram model for spam detection.
- **Probability Calculation**: Calculates spam probabilities based on word frequency.
- **Training and Testing**: Includes processes for both training and testing the model.
- **Results**: Outputs a JSON file with spam probabilities and metrics for model performance (accuracy and precision).
- **User Interface**: The web page displays the name of the file, the percentage chance of it being spam, its class, and the model's accuracy and precision.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
