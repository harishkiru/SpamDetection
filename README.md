# 🌐 Spam Detection Machine Learning Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

Dive into the realm of Machine Learning with our Spam Detection Project! Using a sophisticated unigram approach, this application is a forerunner in identifying and classifying spam messages. It's not just about filtering spam; it's about revolutionizing how we perceive message security and integrity in the digital age.

### ✨ Dazzling Features

- **🔍 Unigram Magic**: Harnessing the power of a unigram model, our system dissects text to its core elements.
- **📊 Precision Probability Calculations**: Every word counts! We calculate the likelihood of spam based on the frequency of each word.
- **🤖 Training & Testing Prowess**: Our model goes through rigorous training and testing, ensuring unmatched accuracy.
- **📈 Results with Clarity**: Outputs are not just numbers; they're insights. Expect a detailed JSON file with spam probabilities and precise model metrics.
- **👁️ Interactive User Interface**: Visualize the spam detection process! Our web page elegantly displays file names, spam probability percentages, classifications, and the crown jewels - model accuracy and precision.
